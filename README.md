## Containers

I heavily use containers during my day to day.
Containers are configured to have volumes mounted into P4RAD0X/containers/{container_name}.

I use docker for creating, managing and running my containers.
On top of docker I use portainer to make my life simpler.

## Projects

In this section there will be multiple different projects that I will create and add too in the future.
